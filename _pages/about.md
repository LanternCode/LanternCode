I completed my BSc at De Montfort University in 2021 with first class in Computing. Then I moved to The University of Leicester for my MSc in Cloud Computing, which I completed in 2022. My MSc project was the backbone of my PhD application and was awarded the Best Technical MSc project award. I was also given the Best Student in Informatics award in November 2022.

In my research, I am actively trying to find a way to apply Graph Rewriting to Graph Neural Networks. I am funded by The University, working as a GTA, under the supervision of Prof. Reiko Heckel.

My first publication was released on the 16th International Conference on Graph Transformation (part of STAF Conferences 2023). It is available online as session 5 of ICGT 2023, second talk. 

In December 2024 I participated in the Data Skeptic podcast and talked with Kyle Polich about my research. The podcast is available on YouTube and other major podcasting platforms.

If you are interested in the subject, please get in touch with me or my supervisor, Professor Reiko Heckel (rh122)!
